===============================================================================
   URGENT UPDATE REQUIRED - LAUNCHER FIX AVAILABLE
===============================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
Your current version has emoji encoding errors that prevent the launcher
from working. This was fixed in the latest version.

ERROR YOU'RE SEEING:
--------------------
"At Launch-MSPToolkit.ps1:57 char:38" - Corrupted emoji characters

SOLUTION - DELETE OLD VERSION AND RE-DOWNLOAD:
----------------------------------------------

1. DELETE these folders completely:
   - C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\msptier3toolkit-main
   - C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\msptier3toolkit-main (2)

2. GO TO GITHUB:
   https://github.com/dirtysouthalpha/msptier3toolkit

3. CLICK the green "Code" button

4. CLICK "Download ZIP"

5. EXTRACT to a NEW location (NOT in Downloads with old versions)

6. RUN "Launch MSP Toolkit.bat"

WHY THIS HAPPENED:
------------------
- You downloaded the toolkit BEFORE the latest fixes were merged
- Windows cached the old version
- The "(2)" in your folder name shows Windows gave you a duplicate
- The latest version on GitHub main branch has ALL fixes applied

ALTERNATIVE - DIRECT FILE REPLACEMENT:
--------------------------------------
If you can't re-download, I can provide the corrected Launch-MSPToolkit.ps1
file content directly. Just let me know.

VERIFICATION:
-------------
The fixed version has ASCII characters like this at line 57:
   "SUCCESS" { "[+]"; $color = "Green" }

NOT emoji characters like this:
   "SUCCESS" { "✓"; $color = "Green" }

===============================================================================
Your GitHub repository is CORRECT and FIXED. You just need a fresh download!
